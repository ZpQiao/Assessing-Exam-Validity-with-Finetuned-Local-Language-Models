    "context": "Among many other things, Australia exports iron ore and coal. The amount of iron ore and coal that is exported a given year can be described by a bivariate normal distribution with the following parameters E(X) = 500, E(Y) = 200,  V(X) = 2500,  V(Y) = 1600 and correlation coefficient $\\rho=\\frac{4}{5}$. We note that the units above are in millions of tons, and that X describes the coal and Y the iron ore.",
